                            <h3>SMP Negeri 2 Sukoharjo</h3>
                            <p>When I first entered SMP Negeri 2 Sukoharjo, I felt a little awkward. The new environment, new friends,
                                and a different atmosphere from elementary school made me have to adapt. However, over time, 
                                I started to enjoy my time there.
                                One of the most memorable experiences was participating in extracurricular activities. 
                                I tried various activities, from sports to school organizations. Apart from that, studying in junior 
                                high school is quite challenging, especially when facing lessons that are more complex than elementary school. 
                                However, with the help of a patient teacher and supportive friends, I was able to get through it well.
                                SMP Negeri 2 Sukoharjo is not only a place to study, but also a place where I grow and develop. 
                                Many experiences have shaped me to become more confident and ready to face challenges in the future.</p>

                            <h3>SMA Negeri 2 Pringsewu</h3>
                            <p>After graduating from junior high school, I continued my education at Pringsewu 2 Public High School, 
                                a place where I further developed myself and discovered my interests and passions. 
                                In high school, the atmosphere is different—more challenging and more opportunities to explore different fields. 
                                From middle school to high school, I learned many things, such as the importance of friendship, hard work, and never giving up. 
                                Every challenge I face teaches me to always try to be better.
                                Now that I am in college, I realize that all my experiences during school have shaped who I am today.
                                I am grateful to have been part of SMP Negeri 2 Sukoharjo and SMA Negeri 2 Pringsewu, two schools that have
                                provided many valuable memories and experiences in my life.</p>

                            <p>Now, I am a student in the Information Technology Study Program at UNY. 
                            The world of college is very different from school. I have to be more independent, 
                            more creative, and more responsible in managing my time and college assignments.
                            At UNY, I met many friends from various regions and different backgrounds. I also started exploring various fields in technology, 
                            including programming, web design, and artificial intelligence. Every day feels full of new challenges, 
                            but also provides many opportunities for growth.</p>

                            <p>My journey started at SMP Negeri 2 Sukoharjo, where I first encountered structured learning and social interactions 
                                that shaped my personality. During this period, I experienced many firsts—my first time joining extracurricular
                                activities, participating in competitions, and working on group projects.
                                The biggest challenge during this time was adjusting to new subjects like mathematics and science, 
                                which required a deeper understanding. But with the support of my teachers and friends, I learned that
                                perseverance and a growth mindset are key to overcoming academic struggles.</p>

                            <h3>Stepping Up the Game</h3>
                            <p>Entering Pringsewu 2 Public High School is a very different and challenging experience. 
                                Academics became more demanding, but this is where I started to explore my true interests.
                                At this school, I met friends who always supported and helped me in solving various challenges. 
                                They also often invite me to play volleyball, which is not only a physical activity, 
                                but also provides a valuable life lesson—that fun and happiness do not only come from personal achievements, 
                                but also from togetherness, cooperation, and simple moments shared with others.
                                Another valuable experience was the university entrance exam preparation process. 
                                This journey taught me the importance of discipline, perseverance, and self-motivation. 
                                I have to be able to manage my time well, dividing my focus between intensive studying and various other
                                school activities. Even though it was full of challenges, this experience shaped my character to be more
                                 independent and responsible, preparing me to face the wider world in the future.</p>

                            <h3>Embracing New Challenges</h3>
                            <p>Now, as a student of Information Technology at UNY, I face even bigger challenges but also greater opportunities. The transition from high school to university required me to be more independent and resourceful.
                                I started learning advanced programming, software development, and digital transformation, which broadened my understanding
                                 of how technology shapes the world.
                                Collaborating with diverse groups of students from different backgrounds helped me improve my communication and teamwork skills.
                                University life also pushed me to develop time management skills, balancing lectures, assignments, and personal projects.
                                One of my biggest experiences so far has been working on real-world projects and attending tech seminars 
                                that gave me insights into the industry. 
                                It has been both challenging and rewarding, and I am excited to see where this journey will take me.</p>
